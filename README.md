## Static Methods and Default methods in Interface (Java +8)
  >> You cannot override the static method of the interface; you can just access them using the name of the interface. If you try to override a static method of an interface by defining a similar method in the implementing interface, it will be considered as another (static) method of the class.

## Functional Programming in Java
  - [Referential Transparency](https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/#referentialtransparencyinprogramming): any call to the program may be replaced with the corresponding return value without changing the result of the program (no side effects).
  
  below is referential transparent method
  ```java
  int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b
  }
  ```
  below is NOT, referential transparent method because replacing the method with the result will change the result of the program since the message will no longer be printed.
  
  ```java
  int add(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    System.out.println("Returning " + result);
    return result;
  }
  ```
  - [Higher Order Function](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-functional-programming/index.html#higher-order-functions): function taking function as an argument and also can returning a function as well.
  - [First Class Citizen](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33695408/6021740): That means that you can create an "instance" of a function, as have a variable reference that function instance. Java doesn't support first class citizen but the closest we have is with lambda expressions (assigning them to variables).

## Java Jigsaw
  - [The primary objective of the Jigsaw project is to introduce the modularity concept to create a module in Java 9 and then applying the same to JDK.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-project-jigsaw-in-java-9)
  - Benefits of Jigsaw(Modularity)
      - Strong Encapsulation
      - Clear Dependecies
      - Reliable
